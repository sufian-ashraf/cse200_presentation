[Solutions Table — p.77]
~20 seconds

"So, for the first case, when the root is red, we simply recolor it red! 
As for the rest of 3 case,
the tree asks one question — is my uncle red or black?
 Red uncle? Easy fix, just recolor.
Black uncle? We need to rotate. And the shape — left-right or right-right —
tells us which rotation.  4 cases, That's it."

[Insert 1–5 Demo — p.80–98]
~15 seconds

"Let's see it in action. Inserting 1 through 5 in order — the exact sequence that
destroys a regular BST. Watch how after each insert, the tree spots the
violation and self-corrects. Every single time. At the end, we get a tree of height 3, compared
to height 5 of regular BST!"

[BST vs RBT Comparison — p.99]
~15 seconds

"This slide says it all. Same data, same order — completely different results. 
Balanced automatically, every time."


--------------------------------------

[Deletion Intro — p.101]
~20 seconds

"Now deletion. Deleting a red node is fine — nothing breaks. But deleting
a black node is a problem. Every path from root to leaf must have the same
number of black nodes. Remove one black node and that guarantee shatters."


--------------------------------------

[Deletion Flowchart — p.111]
~15 seconds

"The flowchart shows it — red node, easy, done. Black node sends us into
a fix-up process. We mark the empty spot as 'Double-Black'
and we have to resolve it."


--------------------------------------

[Delete RED Node — p.112–122]
~10 seconds

"Quick example — node 5, red. Remove it, check black-height, every path
still has 2 black nodes. Done, no fix needed."


--------------------------------------

[Delete BLACK Node — p.123–134]
~20 seconds

"Now node 1, black. Remove it — left path is now shorter, black-height
violated. We mark it Double-Black, after some rotations and recoloring...balance is restored."


--------------------------------------

[4 Fix Cases — p.135–156]
~20 seconds

"Each case on screen shows a Before and After. Don't worry about
memorizing the steps — just notice one thing: every transformation
is moving the Double-Black node closer to resolution. The tree is
always making progress, never stuck."


--------------------------------------

[Summary / Chain Diagram — p.157–159]
~20 seconds

"And here's why it always works — these cases form a chain. Cases 1
and 3 are setup moves that funnel into Case 4, which is the actual fix.
Case 2 might push the problem upward but always terminates.
No matter where you start, balance is guaranteed."


--------------------------------------
And Yeah, if your head is spinning right now,
it's totally normal. 
The point isn't to memorize every case, it's to understand that a fix always exists.


[Handoff — p.167–169]
~15 seconds

"So was all of that worth it? That's what we'll see next — because
Red-Black Trees guarantee O(log n) for insert, delete, and search
in every case, no matter what."

DELIVERY NOTES:
- Slow down on: "Two questions, 4 cases. That's it."
- Let the animation breathe during the Insert 1-5 demo, don't talk over it
- "Think of it as a chain" is your anchor line — say it clearly
- Everything else can move at pace
